## More Than a Million Moves
There are an average of 10<sup>120</sup> possible games of chess, according to [Hercules Chess](https://herculeschess.com/how-many-chess-games-are-possible/). This is greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe. This was calculated as on average, in any given turn, there are 30 legal moves you could make. With so many possible moves in so many possible games, how do you know what's a good move or not?

Back when I was in Chess Club, and each club meeting would begin with an introduction and explanation of a chess move. The Scotch Opening, Dutch Defense, Queen's Gambit, and so on. Our club advisor would go into the history of each move, what each move was, and how to counter it. If I'm being honest, I had no real interest in learning about these moves. I just enjoyed playing chess off-the-cuff, and didn't really see the point in learning about chess openings from 50 years ago. When I played against a new opponent, it wasn't as if our game was going to follow one of those old games to a tee, so what was the point in learning about those moves?

## 
While it's impossible to even think of trying to memorize all possible chess games and moves, being able to recognize a select few can prove advantageous. Recognizing moves that your opponent is using can give you insight into what they might do next and how to properly counter and win.

Humans are pattern-recognition machines. It's why we see faces in inanimate objects. Whenever we see or experience something new, our minds immediately compare it to similar situations we've been in in the past so we know how to react.

When coding a structure, we may come across a problem or a feature that we want to implement. We don't need to reinvent the wheel each time, and instead, can turn to design patterns. Design patterns provides us with a template solution to use for other similar problems. Knowing various design patterns can guide us when structuring our code. 

## Realize, Recognize, (Meteor) React
One such design pattern is the Observer Design Pattern. 
- one used in our project: Observer Design Pattern, particularly when coding for reactive data.
