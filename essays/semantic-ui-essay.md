UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to 
learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? 
What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? 
Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. 
You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with 
Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, 
it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

This essay is tailor made to include an image of a web page built with a UI framework 
(or even a comparison of web pages built with and without a UI framework).

Feel free to go in another direction entirely, as long as you are discussing UI Frameworks, 
and as long as the result is interesting, informative, and insightful. Write for the world!

## Design for You and I
When I first learned HTML and CSS, it became extremely easy to design websites. 

Well, to be exact, it became extremely easy to design horrendous-looking websites.

I used to think that writing raw HTML and CSS from scratch was the only way to design a website. I'll spare you the neon eyesore (Middle school Carol knew nothing about graphic design), but my few dips into website design led me to believe that designing a website was annoyingly time-consuming. For example, having a comfortable padding on the far left and right of elements makes 

and don't even get me started on different screen sizes. Even though I knew 

Semantic UI and other frameworks do a lot of the background work for you, and simplifies a lot of the code that you have to write when designing your websites.
