So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If you’re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?


## The Good Old Days
In high school, I took an Intro to Computer Science class, where JavaScript was our main focus. That was my first dedicated computer science class, so I was worried that I would struggle to keep up. However, I found that it was easy to pick up. Compared to what I now know from Java and C++, I find JavaScript to be the most logical for me. From a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is a good programming language. It's especially good for beginners. It has a shallow learning curve, but still has a lot of depth so that you are able to do a lot with the language. 

## The New and Intimidating 
Coming into ICS 314, with at least a little bit of knowledge on JavaScript, I wasn’t as nervous as I would have been otherwise. I went through the JavaScript course briskly, refreshing my memory on JavaScript syntax and how the language worked. However, I was very surprised about some of the things I learned that were available in ES6. The many different functions and the sheer amount of all of the things you can do with JavaScript left me reeling. While the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp was more of a review for me, I've never even seen any of the things covered in the ES6 course. But while I initially felt a little bit intimidated when faced with how much I still have to learn, I felt a larger part of myself excited at the possibilities that ES6 presents. 

## Practice, Practice, Practice! ...And Then Practice, Practice, Practice Some More
