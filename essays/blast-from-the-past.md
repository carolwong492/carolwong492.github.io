So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If you’re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?


What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?


## The Good Old Days
In high school, I took an Intro to Computer Science class, where JavaScript was our main focus. This was my first dedicated computer science class, so I was worried that I would struggle to keep up. However, I found that it was easy to pick up. Compared to what I now know from Java and C++, I find JavaScript to be the most logical for me. From a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is a good programming language. It's especially good for beginners. It has a shallow learning curve, but still has a lot of depth so that you are able to do a lot with the language.

Since I was coming into this module with at least a little bit of knowledge, I wasn’t as nervous as I could have been. However, 

Technology is constantly updating and 



Talk about how i learned javascript in high school, but im a bit rusty. At first, i was afraid that i knew nothing at all. Something about how technology is always getting updated when i was doing the es6 stuff and how sometimes, it feels like you’ll fall behind if you don’t keep up with this stuff
