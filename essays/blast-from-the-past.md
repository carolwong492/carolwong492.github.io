So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## The Good Old Days
In high school, I took an Intro to Computer Science class, where JavaScript was our main focus. This was my first dedicated computer science class, so I was really nervous that I would struggle to keep up. However, I think that JavaScript is a really nice programming language for beginners. It has a shallow learning curve, but still has a lot of depth to be able to do a lot with the language. I found that it easy to pick up and a lot of it seemed logical to me, in a way that Java or C++ didn't.

From a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is a good programming language.
