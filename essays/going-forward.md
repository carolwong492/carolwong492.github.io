Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill youâ€™ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:
- Open Source Software Development
- Configuration Management
- Functional Programming
- Development Environments
- Coding Standards
- User Interface Frameworks
- Agile Project Management
- Design Patterns
- Ethics in Software Engineering
For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Web application development was always something I was interested in. Whenever someone asked me what I planned to do after I graduated, I always answered with working in software development or website creation. ICS 314: Introduction to Software Engineering seemed to be the perfect match for my interests.

Open source software had seemed strange to me at first. I was of the mindset that having code on the Internet like that meant people would just come to steal it and profit off of it. It seemed like a 

Github seemed so intimidating at first. There was a lot of new vocabulary to learn and it was my first experience with any sort of collaborative code-sharing site. At first, I was very afraid that I would somehow mess up and overwrite my code or delete it somehow.

  - Github was so intimidating but it became very easy to use and very useful 

- Ethics in Software Engineering

Our last day of class saw us debating a technology-related moral question. We were assigned to various readings about the ethical responsibilities that creators in tech hold, such as following the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) as well as a variety of case studies, such as [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)).

The ethical debate goes as follows:
```Now, assume that you work at WatchMe Inc as a software engineer. You have just been assigned to work on the GetFace system, which is a facial recognition system that WatchMe is marketing to law enforcement agencies across the country. You have discovered that the project does not observe several of the guidelines proposed by the ACLU to ensure ethical use of the technology. Specifically:

Informed consent was not obtained from the individuals whose faces are being used to train the system.
Citizens do not have the ability to access, edit, or delete their information.
There are no dedicated security professionals for maintaining the security and privacy of the information.
The results of the facial recognition algorithm are sold without informed, written consent```

 Our groups were randomly assigned which side we were to argue for and given 20 minutes to prepare. Of the two resources given to us, the odds seemed incredibly stacked against 
      - arguing a point that i didnt agree with at first actually made me open my mind to other points of views and realize
      - that things arent so black and white . esp with technology, a lot of this is so new that we are in the process of 
      - figuring out what is good and bad.
