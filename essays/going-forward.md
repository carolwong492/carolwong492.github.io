## A Look Back
Web application development was always something I was interested in. Whenever someone asked me what I planned to do after I graduated, I always answered with working in software development or website creation. ICS 314: Introduction to Software Engineering seemed to be the perfect match for my interests.

## Sharing Knowledge
Open source software had seemed strange to me at first. I was of the mindset that having code freely available on the Internet meant that people would just come to steal it and profit off of it. There didn't seem to be any benefits to doing so. 

However, open source development only propels the entire industry forward as a whole. 

Github seemed so intimidating at first. There was a lot of new vocabulary to learn and it was my first experience with any sort of collaborative code-sharing site. At first, I was very afraid that I would somehow mess up and overwrite my code or delete it somehow.

## Good and Evil Aren't So Binary 
Our last day of class saw us debating a technology-related moral question. We were assigned to various readings about the ethical responsibilities that creators in tech hold, such as following the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) as well as a variety of case studies, such as [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)). Our groups were randomly assigned which side we were to argue for and given 20 minutes to prepare.

The ethical debate goes as follows:
```
Now, assume that you work at WatchMe Inc as a software engineer. 
You have just been assigned to work on the GetFace system, which 
is a facial recognition system that WatchMe is marketing to 
law enforcement agencies across the country. You have discovered 
that the project does not observe several of the guidelines 
proposed by the ACLU to ensure ethical use of the technology. 
Specifically: 
 - Informed consent was not obtained from the individuals whose 
   faces are being used to train the system. 
 - Citizens do not have the ability to access, edit, or 
   delete their information.
 - There are no dedicated security professionals for maintaining
   the security and privacy of the information.
 - The results of the facial recognition algorithm are sold 
   without informed, written consent
```
My group was assigned the side that it was ethical to work for this company. Accompanied with a couple of links to resources on all of the many ethical problems with facial recognition software, and it seemed as if the odds were incredibly stacked against us. I went into the debate personally siding with the opposition, especially after reading all of the problems with racism, privacy, and data collection that facial recognition software holds. 

However, as my group and I discussed the topic more, I soon realized the topic wasn't as clear-cut as I initially thought. While the technology itself could be unethical, that doesn't mean the act of working for this company is unethical as well. There's a lot of social and economic factors that come into play when trying to decide what is good and what is bad. 

This experience really opened my eyes to how the morality of a given action isn't so easily decided, and that everyone will hold their own views on what is right and wrong. In the cases of technology, because it is so new, we are currently in the process of what is the pros and cons of every action and how they can hurt or help people.
