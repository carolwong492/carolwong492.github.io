Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Be sure that your essay includes a textual summary of both the “smart” and “not so smart” questions, as well as a link to the StackOverFlow pages where they are located. Don’t just put the URL to the questions and force the reader to visit StackOverFlow to read the question there, then switch back to your essay to continue. Your essay should contain enough detail about the two questions so that the reader doesn’t need to visit StackOverFlow to make sense of your essay.

## The Right Questions
Asking questions is important. When we're learning something new, having questions about the material is a good sign that you're paying attention and thinking critically about the subject. I used to be afraid of asking questions. I held my mouth shut, not wanting to seem dumb or annoying. However, I learned the hard way that avoiding asking questions only hurts you in the end. 

If you're like how I was, it's important to learn how to ask questions, and more importantly, how to ask *smart* questions. Asking smart questions doesn't make you look dumb, it makes you look inquisitive and willing to learn more. With the Internet, troubleshooting is easier than ever. The answers to most of our questions are at our fingertips. But just because we're not face-to-face, it's still important to ask questions in a way that respects the time of everyone involved. 

The most important thing to know about asking smart questions is to know that it's okay to be ignorant, but it's not okay to be rude. Often, people who help answer your questions are doing so for free in their own spare time, so being entitled is not a flattering look and will not get you an answer any faster. 

## Good Lessons From Bad Examples
To learn how to compose a smart question, it's can help to see how to ask a *not so smart* question. Ren'Py is a visual novel making engine that is built off of the programming language Python. While Ren'Py has its own programming logic, users can use Python to add anything else they want to add to their game. 

In [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69848012/my-renpy-code-just-fails-at-working-labels-are-broken-menus-are-broken-all-thing), this user's header is "My renpy code just fails at working labels are broken menus are broken all things are just dead," which is already a red-flag. In the header of posts, you should include only meaningful, specific information that applies to your question. It's the first thing that anyone sees about your post, so it's the best way to grab someone who can help you's attention and alert them to what your issue is. In this header, the issue at hand isn't clear at all. In addition to that, having improper grammar doesn't give a great first impression.

Within the post itself, the poor grammar continues and that can make the issue harder to parse. It begins with unneccessary information with, "My renpy code just dies." After that, all the information that is given is one run-on sentence and a short snippet of code that "completely broke the game." The user doesn't provide the error message that Ren'Py supplies. Without enough information to know for sure what is wrong, people are left to guess at a solution. Answering this question will require a lot of clarification and back-and-forth. For possible responders, this question will seem like a really annoying timesink that could've been avoided if enough information was given in the original post. 

Asking questions in a not-so-smart way will lower the likelihood that someone will actually put in the time to answer your question. 

//

Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).

Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.

Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.

Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.

If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.



## Good Lessons From Good Examples, Too

Smart questions should include 
This included their attempt at fixing it, along with different code snippets of what they are trying to do and where they got their initial code from. They explain how they tried to solve their problem in multiple attempts. They are asking for an explanation for why their code isn't working as they think it's supposed to, and give a clear description of what that is exactly. 

## Lessons Learned
Asking smart questions guarantees an answer quicker and makes the whole experience less annoying for everyone involved.
