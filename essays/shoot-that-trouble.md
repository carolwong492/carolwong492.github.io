Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Be sure that your essay includes a textual summary of both the “smart” and “not so smart” questions, as well as a link to the StackOverFlow pages where they are located. Don’t just put the URL to the questions and force the reader to visit StackOverFlow to read the question there, then switch back to your essay to continue. Your essay should contain enough detail about the two questions so that the reader doesn’t need to visit StackOverFlow to make sense of your essay.

## Intro

Asking smart questions is important. You can't not ask any questions, just because you're afraid of looking dumb.
If you're afraid of looking dumb, it's actually even more important to learn how to ask questions. Asking smart questions doesn't make you look dumb, it makes you look inquisitive and willing to learn more and able to engage in some critical thinking. 
Of course the biggest rule is that it's okay to be ignorant, it's not okay to be rude. Often, people who help on these forums are doing so for free in their own spare time, so being entitled to an answer is not a flattering look. 

## Not so Smart Questions
Ren'Py is a python off-shoot. Visual novel making engine. 
Doesn't provide the error message. We don't know if it's because it's not defined. All we know is that it just "completely broke the game". A very simple error that can probably be solved just by reading the documentation for Renpy. The header is not helpful. Bad grammar. Not enoughh info to really know for sure what is wrong. Without the error message, we are left to guess at a solution, as we don't really know what's wrong. It is a minimal case? Maybe?

Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).

Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.

Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.

Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.

If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.



## Smart Questions
Smart questions should include 
This included their attempt at fixing it, along with different code snippets of what they are trying to do and where they got their initial code from. They explain how they tried to solve their problem in multiple attempts. They are asking for an explanation for why their code isn't working as they think it's supposed to, and give a clear description of what that is exactly. 

## lessons learned 
Asking smart questions guarantees an answer quicker and makes the whole experience less annoying for everyone involved.
