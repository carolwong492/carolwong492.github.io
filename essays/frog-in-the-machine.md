Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

## Running Smoothly
Coding standards are rules and practices that make the most readable and most efficient code. It helps protect against minor errors and just gives your code a clean feel. Needless to say, when working in a group, they're essential to making sure that others can quickly read your code and edit accordingly. Though they can be a bit boring and annoying to keep track of, coding standards are an essential cog in the machine. Code that doesn't comply to an agreed-upon coding standard will exponentially increase the time team-members spend working, as a large portion of their time will be spent trying to deduce what you wrote. In fact, you might even confuse yourself if you don't follow coding standards, as you might have to spend time looking through messy code for a missing parenthesis or some other minor issue.

By skipping coding standards, you may feel that you save a few extra seconds, not worrying about the readability of the code, and instead, focusing on getting the program to work as quickly as possible. But without that essential cog in the machine, you're left with a plethora of bugs that no amount of frogs could eat up.

## Grinds My Gears
One time, in my high school Intro to Computer Science class, we were randomly paired up to inspect each other's code for our end-of-quarter project. I heaved my backpack over to my seatmate and we swapped laptops. I gave a cursory glance at their code and tried scrolling down. When the scrollbar didn't appear on the side of the screen, but on the *bottom,* I knew that this was not going to be fun. I looked closer to see that yes, this was a horizontal scroll bar with a scroll box smaller than my pinky nail. In fascinated horror, I scrolled to the right and watched as hundreds of characters passed by, all formatted on a singular line. I turned, slack-jawed, at my partner's audacity, and they merely shrugged and said they liked having it on the fewest amount of lines as possible. My headache lasted until the end of the day.

And I don't know, maybe my partner genuinely coded better like that. Maybe having three hundred &&'s and \|\|'s all on one line was truly how they enjoyed working. But as an outsider, I could hardly parse what each line was supposed to do, much less how to improve the code.

After that harrowing experience, I vowed to always maintain the neatest and most readable code that I could. In every new IDE I used, one of the first things I would search up would be the keyboard shortcut to fix my indentation. I would press it every time I finished a couple of lines of code until it just became habit.

## ESLint
Even though I am the number one supporter of coding standards, what exactly is defined as being "coding standard" differs from IDE to IDE, or language to language, or even person to person.

I mean, seeing that green checkmark in the corner is very gratifying.
