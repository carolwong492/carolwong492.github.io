I decided to do a bird cafe named "Hawkward". A bird cafe would have be similar in concept to a cat cafe, except with birds instead of cats. 

Because it was a cafe, I also had to design the menu of the shop. Sticking to a warmer yellow and brown color scheme, I wanted this cafe to have a rustic and cute vibe. I made sure the logo, a small bird, was round and cute to fit this theme. The font I chose was also bubbly and round. 

The concept and art was entered into the Pele Awards High School Division. Hawkward Bird Cafe placed Silver in the Specialty Advertising (Other) division.
