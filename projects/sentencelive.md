summary: A two-player fighting game I developed using JavaScript.

sentence.Live is a two-player fighting game developed in my junior year Intro to Computer Science course in high school. The game was made on [code.org](https://code.org/). The site uses [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), a library created for users to code in JavaScript using block-based programming. However, we were discouraged from using the blocks when coding, and instead told to type it out instead.

For the game, the two players share one keyboard for input, with one player using WASD to move and V and B to attack, while the other player uses the arrow keys to move and L and K to attack. The menu and character select screen use mouse input. 

For this project, I did the programming, character design, and art. Placeholder art was used as I focused on making sure that all of the code worked first. I learned how to accept different forms of input in JavaScript, as well as physics mechanics for the characters' movement. I also had to take account of collisions so that the characters didn't fall through the floor and so that the hits were reflected in their health bar. 

The game can be played and the code can be viewed [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/7Ns_XQvP99pPVCVWe3YGuzr6EyS6dDP3NgYoeRpcsdQ).
