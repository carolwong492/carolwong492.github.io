sentence.Live is a two-player fighting game developed in my junior year Intro to Computer Science course in high school. The site used was [code.org](https://code.org/). The site uses [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), a library created for users to code in JavaScript using block-based programming. However, we were discouraged from using the blocks when coding, and instead told to type it out instead.

Within the game, the two players share one keyboard for input, with one player using WASD to move and V and B to attack, while the other player uses the arrow keys to move and L and K to attack. The menu and character select screen use mouse input. 

For this project, I did the programming and the art. I learned how to implement different forms of input in JavaScript, and physics to enable the characters jumping. I also had to take account of collisions so that the characters didn't fall through the floor and so that the hits they took were reflected in their health bar. 

A lot of the art that is used was placeholder art that I intended to replace once I 

The game can be played and the code can be viewed [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/7Ns_XQvP99pPVCVWe3YGuzr6EyS6dDP3NgYoeRpcsdQ).
