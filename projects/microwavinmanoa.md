## What is Microwavin Manoa?
As many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints, they may choose to spend money to eat out or choose unhealthy options such as fast food places or vending machines. 

Our final project in ICS 314 was to develop a solution to this problem. Microwavin Manoa aims to solve this problem by creating a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that could be made with minimal kitchen facilities out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH. The recipes could be filtered in various ways, such as to dietary restrictions or preferences such as recipes that could be made in 10 minutes. Each recipe had an estimated cost, number of servings, and time to make it.

This was a group project where I collaborated with three others, using Meteor, React, Uniforms, and Semantic UI React. The site was deployed [here](https://microwavinmanoa.me/#/) with Digital Ocean. The GitHub page which contains more info on the site is linked [here](https://microwavin-manoa.github.io/).
