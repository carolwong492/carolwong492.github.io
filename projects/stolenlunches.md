Flash Mobs and Stolen Lunches is an interactive fiction game that I created for the I Can't Write but Want to Tell a Story Game Jam and the [Summer Novel Game Jam](ttps://itch.io/jam/sunofes20). 

The game jam lasted for a month. During that time, I learned how to use [Twine](https://twinery.org/), which is an open-source tool used to make interactive fiction projects using webpages. The 

I wrote the story, created the art, and managed the CSS for the game. 



Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
